# Example with CSS

<ComponentPreview name="example-with-css" />

## Installation

Copy and paste the following files into your project:

<ComponentSource name="example-with-css" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { ExampleCard } from "@/components/example-card"

export function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-50">
      <ExampleCard />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Features

- **CSS + Tailwind** - Combines custom CSS with Tailwind utility classes
- **Custom Animations** - Uses CSS animations for enhanced UX
- **Form Styling** - Custom styled form inputs and buttons
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly login form
- **Modern Design** - Clean, professional appearance

## CSS Integration

This component shows how to:

- **Import CSS files** alongside TypeScript components
- **Use CSS modules** for scoped styling
- **Combine CSS classes** with Tailwind utilities
- **Create custom animations** that work with Tailwind

## Custom Styles

The component includes custom CSS for:

- **Input focus effects** - Custom border and shadow animations
- **Button hover states** - Smooth color transitions
- **Card shadows** - Enhanced depth and visual hierarchy
- **Typography** - Custom font styling and spacing

## File Structure

```
example-with-css/
├── example-card.tsx  # React component
└── example-card.css  # Custom styles
```

## Best Practices

When combining CSS with Tailwind:

- **Use CSS for complex animations** that are hard to achieve with utilities
- **Keep Tailwind for layout** and basic styling
- **Scope CSS classes** to avoid conflicts
- **Document custom CSS** for maintainability

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: Tailwind's utility-first approach with the power of custom CSS when needed.
