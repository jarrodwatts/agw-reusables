title: Abstract Contracts
description: Common contract addresses and ABIs for tokens and DEX infrastructure on Abstract with utility functions for network-aware address resolution
---

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://agw-reusables.vercel.app/r/abstract-contracts.json"
```

## Usage

Access contract addresses directly.

```tsx
import { ABSTRACT_CONTRACTS } from "@/components/abstract-contracts"

const wethMainnet = ABSTRACT_CONTRACTS.tokens.weth.addresses.mainnet
// "0x3439153EB7AF838Ad19d56E1571FBD09333C2809"

const usdcTestnet = ABSTRACT_CONTRACTS.tokens.usdc.addresses.testnet
// "0xe4C7fBB0a626ed208021ccabA6Be1566905E2dFc"
```

### Specify chain ID

Get contract addresses for mainnet or testnet specifically.

```tsx
import { getContract, getContractAddress } from "@/components/abstract-contracts"
import { abstract, abstractTestnet } from "viem/chains"

// Get contract for specific chain
const wethMainnet = getContract("weth", abstract.id)
const wethTestnet = getContract("weth", abstractTestnet.id)

// Get just address for specific chain
const usdcMainnetAddress = getContractAddress(
  ABSTRACT_CONTRACTS.tokens.usdc.addresses,
  abstract.id
)
```

### Network-aware Address Resolution

Get contract addresses for the currently active chain (mainnet or testnet).

```tsx
// Automatically uses mainnet or testnet based on config
import { getContractWithCurrentChain, getContractAddressWithCurrentChain } from "@/components/abstract-contracts"

const wethContract = getContractWithCurrentChain("weth") // Returns an object with metadata
console.log(wethContract.address) // Just the contract address

// Get just the contract address for the current chain
const usdcAddress = getContractAddressWithCurrentChain("usdc")
```

### Network Utilities

Some helpful utility functions for working with Abstract networks.

```tsx
import { isAbstractNetwork, getNetworkName } from "@/components/abstract-contracts"

// Check if chain ID is supported
if (isAbstractNetwork(chainId)) {
  const networkName = getNetworkName(chainId)
  console.log(`Connected to ${networkName}`)
}
```

## What's included

This command installs the following files:

- `/components`
  - [`abstract-contracts.tsx`](#abstract-contractstsx) - Main exports for contracts, utilities, and types

- `/lib`
  - [`contracts.ts`](#contractsts) - Contract addresses, ABIs, and configuration
  - [`utils.ts`](#utilsts) - Network-aware utility functions for address resolution
  - [`types.ts`](#typests) - TypeScript type definitions

### `abstract-contracts.tsx`

A configuration module that exports contract addresses, ABIs, and utility functions for Abstract's token and DEX infrastructure with automatic network detection.

<ComponentSource src="registry/new-york/blocks/abstract-contracts/abstract-contracts.tsx" />

### `contracts.ts`

Contract configuration containing addresses for both Abstract mainnet and testnet, along with complete ABIs for tokens (WETH, USDC, USDT) and Uniswap V2/V3 infrastructure.

<ComponentSource src="registry/new-york/blocks/abstract-contracts/lib/contracts.ts" />

#### Available Contracts

**Tokens:**
- `weth` - Wrapped Ether (WETH9)
- `usdc` - USD Coin stablecoin
- `usdt` - Tether USD stablecoin (mainnet only)

**DEX Infrastructure:**
- `uniswapV2Factory` - Uniswap V2 factory for pair creation
- `uniswapV2Router` - Uniswap V2 router for swaps and liquidity
- `uniswapV3Factory` - Uniswap V3 factory for pool creation
- `quoterV2` - Uniswap V3 quoter for swap price quotes
- `swapRouter02` - Uniswap V3 router for executing swaps

### `utils.ts`

Utility functions for network-aware contract address resolution with automatic mainnet/testnet selection and error handling.

<ComponentSource src="registry/new-york/blocks/abstract-contracts/lib/utils.ts" />

#### Utility Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `getContract(key, chainId)` | Get full contract info with address for specific chain |
| `getContractWithCurrentChain(key)` | Get contract info using current chain configuration |
| `getContractAddress(addresses, chainId)` | Get contract address for specific chain |
| `getContractAddressWithCurrentChain(key)` | Get address using current chain configuration |
| `findContract(key)` | Search for contract by key across all categories |
| `isAbstractNetwork(chainId)` | Check if chain ID is Abstract mainnet or testnet |
| `getNetworkName(chainId)` | Get human-readable network name |

### `types.ts`

TypeScript type definitions for contract configuration, network IDs, and utility function options.

<ComponentSource src="registry/new-york/blocks/abstract-contracts/lib/types.ts" />

#### Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ContractInfo` | Contract metadata including name, description, addresses, and ABI |
| `ContractAddress` | Mapping of network names to contract addresses |
| `ContractsConfig` | Top-level configuration structure for tokens and DEX contracts |
| `NetworkId` | Union type for Abstract mainnet (2741) and testnet (11124) |
