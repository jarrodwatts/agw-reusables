---

Proper prompts and context are an important part of building with AI developer tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). Below are installable rule files and MCP servers that help guide AI to build more optimally with Abstract and AGW Reusables:

- [Cursor](#cursor): `.cursor/rules/default.mdc` and `.cursor/mcp.json`
- [Claude Code](#claude-code): `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Cursor

Configuration files for Cursor IDE with Abstract-specific rules and MCP server setup.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://agw-reusables.vercel.app/r/cursor-ai-config.json"
```

Installs `.cursor/rules/default.mdc` and `.cursor/mcp.json` with Abstract ecosystem development patterns.

## Claude Code

Configuration files for Claude Code with project instructions and Abstract documentation MCP server.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://agw-reusables.vercel.app/r/claude-config.json"
```

Installs `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json` with Abstract-specific development guidance and MCP server access to Abstract documentation.
